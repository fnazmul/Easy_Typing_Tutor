      Welcome you all to `Easy Typing,version 1.0'- First of all, thank you for using this software. It is prepared as a part of our academic course. Infact, this is the first project for us.So we may have many faults. But we expect that you would   kindly overlook the limitations and encourage our effort. If you like any  single bit of our program-we will feel proud then.
   First of all, we are grateful to Almighty     Allah. Then thanks to all our family members who  didn't get bored when we work all day long in our lines of code,the nose on the computer screen!  
Without their support n' kindness, this software wouldn't exist! Thanks to our respected JULIUS sir and MAMUN sir. And then finally, we wish to thank our friends who gave us ideas for making the     outlook a little bit    professional.
