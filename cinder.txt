Cinderella was a beautiful and kind-hearted young girl, who lived with her father, step-mother and two ugly and cruel step-sisters. The sisters were very jealous of Cinderella and  treated her very badly.
Oneday her sisters were invited to a grand Ball at the Palace. They left her alone. When they had left, Cinderella sat weeping in her room. Suddenly a Fairy came and said, "I will grant your wishes". "I wanna go to the Ball", said Cinderella, "but I cannot go like this!". Fairy Godmother told her
to bring a pumpkin, some ratsand mice and turned all these to golden carriage, coachman
and white horses. "Now to dress you like a princess", said the Fairy.
Suddenly Cinderella was standing in a beautiful satin gown with wonderful glass slippers-"You must be back at midnight or the spell will be broken", said the Fairy Godmother. "I promise", said Cinderella. As  she entered the palace the prince refused to dance with anyone else and Cinderella was so happy that she forgot the Fairy's warning!
When the clock struck twelve Cinderella remembered her promise and ran from the ballroom. As she rushed, one of her sippers fell off and was left behind on the staircase!
The prince decided to marry  the beautiful girl he had danced with. His messengers announced that whoever fitted the slipper would be the princess.
One day they arrived at Cinderella's house. To the step-sisters' amazement the slipper fit on her foot!
The Fairy Godmother then suddenly reappeared and touched
Cinderella with her wand. Cinderella was transformed into a beautiful Princess again.
"At last I've found you", said the Prince. It was not long before they were married and Cinderella lived happily ever after with her Prince.
